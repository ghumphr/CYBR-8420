## Claims

### **Claim 1 - Augusto**
![Assurance Case 1](./Diagrams/Assurance-Case-1.png)

**Part 2 Assessment** - 
*E1 – Application Security Process*: Canvas LMS takes many steps to prevent pushing a known vulnerability into their patches, one of the steps is doing Security Audits, which they release to the public, latest one here [Canvas Security Audit 2023](https://www.instructure.com/sites/default/files/file/2023-04/Canvas_Security%20Audit_Report_2023.pdf). The Security Audits help Canvas LMS find critical/high/medium/low/information vulnerabilities, and how it impacts them. Helping investors and customers feel more secure, which each progress.

*E-2  – Admin Guide: Roles and Permissions*: Canvas LMS has detail documentation on how to implement Roles and Permissions in their Admin Guide, under Roles and Permissions. The document can be found here [What user roles and permissions are avialable in Canvas?](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/What-user-roles-and-permissions-are-available-in-Canvas/ta-p/102 ). Even do it do not cover every possible scenario, it covers a large majority of it. They also include the Canvas Account Permissions resource document here [Canvas Account Role Permissions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-Account-Role-Permissions/ta-p/387078).

*E-3 – Security Testing*: On their main page, under Security, Canvas LMS promises users that they implement both preventative and detective mechanism thought the Software Development Life Cycle. They also implement a full QA test before they can push any update.

*E-4 – Bug Bounty Program*: Canvas LMS has a private bug bounty program, this is great because it can keep a lot of their vulnerabilities away from the public. Preventing bad actors from acting on does vulnerabilities before they are fixed. There is a process to be part of the program, which involves you submitting your Bugcrowd username and resume to security@instructore.com, a bad actor can use social engineering to get into the program. It is not clear if there are additional steps to prevent this.

### **Claim 2 - Canvas LMS Minimizes Unauthorized Access**
![Assurance Case 2](./Diagrams/Assurance-Case-2.png)

**Part 2 Assessment** - 

*E1 - Compliance Report*: Canvas LMS product compliance packages are available upon request at: [Canvas Compliance Report](https://www.instructure.com/trust-center/resources). While Canvas LMS offers access to compliance reports, it is unclear how reliable delivery is upon request. Additionally, it's uncertain whether these reports contain adequate details regarding critical security features like MFA or incident response information.  

*E2 - Penetration Test Results*: Penetration testing is completed annually through Bugcrowd, Inc. and the reports are availabe on the Instructure site. The latest report can be found at: [Canvas LMS Pentestig Report](https://www.instructure.com/sites/default/files/file/2023-04/Canvas_Security%20Audit_Report_2023.pdf). Potential gaps in pentesting results may include a limited testing scope, an insufficiently comprehensive methodology that fails to identify all types of XSS vulnerabilities, or uncertainty about whether the test was conducted in a test environment or the live production environment.

*E3 - Security Audit Logs*: Instructure maintains a Security Overview document that covers physical security for data centers, detailing the use of state-of-the-art electronic surveillance and multi-factor access control systems. Data centers are protected 24/7 by trained security guards and access is authorized strictly on a least-privileged basis. Security Audit Logs are available for review by security staff with appropriate levels of access. The Security Overview document can be found at: [Canvas LMS Security Overview Policy](https://www.instructure.com/trust-center/resources). A potential gap for review of security audit logs is human error, poor log retention policies, or inadequate review frequency.
