**Part 2 Assessment** - 

*E1 - Compliance Report*: Canvas LMS product compliance packages are available upon request at: [Canvas Compliance Report](https://www.instructure.com/trust-center/resources). While Canvas LMS offers access to compliance reports, it is unclear how reliable delivery is upon request. Additionally, it's uncertain whether these reports contain adequate details regarding critical security features like MFA or incident response information.  

*E2 - Penetration Test Results*: Penetration testing is completed annually through Bugcrowd, Inc. and the reports are availabe on the Instructure site. The latest report can be found at: [Canvas LMS Pentestig Report](https://www.instructure.com/sites/default/files/file/2023-04/Canvas_Security%20Audit_Report_2023.pdf). Potential gaps in pentesting results may include a limited testing scope, an insufficiently comprehensive methodology that fails to identify all types of XSS vulnerabilities, or uncertainty about whether the test was conducted in a test environment or the live production environment.

*E3 - Security Audit Logs*: Instructure maintains a Security Overview document that covers physical security for data centers, detailing the use of state-of-the-art electronic surveillance and multi-factor access control systems. Data centers are protected 24/7 by trained security guards and access is authorized strictly on a least-privileged basis. Security Audit Logs are available for review by security staff with appropriate levels of access. The Security Overview document can be found at: [Canvas LMS Security Overview Policy](https://www.instructure.com/trust-center/resources). A potential gap for review of security audit logs is human error, poor log retention policies, or inadequate review frequency.
