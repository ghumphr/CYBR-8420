## Part 2 Observations

Canvas LMS is designed with security in mind, but like any software platform, it may still be susceptible to vulnerabilities. One potential design-related gap highlighted by the DFD analysis is the absence of a database firewall; however, it is possible that such a feature is in place but not publicly disclosed. While Canvas LMS seems to implement a robust network security strategy, past evaluations have uncovered vulnerabilities in its security measures. For instance, although the platform provides protections against CSRF and XSS attacks, this does not guarantee that its mitigation capabilities are entirely free of flaws or limitations.

## Team Reflection

This week’s assignment was a bit different from the previous ones in terms of dividing the workload and coordinating our inputs. In the last two assignments, each team member was responsible for creating a diagram. However, for this assignment, we quickly determined that only one diagram was needed. One teammate took on the task of creating and updating the diagram, while the rest of us divided up the threats. Afterward, we had to determine the best way to coordinate and compile our inputs, as GitHub didn’t seem practical for this purpose. Most of our coordination was done through Discord via chat and voice discussions. Filtering updates through GitHub felt more cumbersome compared to completing our individual portions and then meeting to consolidate them into a single HTML file. Ultimately, we adapted and successfully completed the assignment.
